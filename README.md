Music Player for Android - using Reactive Extenstion (RxJava)


## !!PLEASE READ!!
This project was a summer project which I had to *drop* at that time. The motivation for the project was to learn RxJava and Kotlin by building a very basic yet usable music player. Since dropping the project, I have noticed some activity on the repo. It has been viewed by many for it's unique [Event Bus](https://github.com/DarkestFloyd/Melody/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/m/nischal/melody/Util/BusEvents.java) based on RxJava. It is not the prettiest, but worked surprisingly well. One of my [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37716396/best-way-to-handle-recyclerview-item-clicks-using-rx-android/37795466#37795466) can help you understand the same. Apart from the Event bus, the [gradle build file](https://github.com/DarkestFloyd/Melody/blob/develop/app/build.gradle#L55-L91) also has the functionality of automatically incrementing the build numbers based on the type of build, which for that time, was pretty advanced.

Just a word of advise, please __DO NOT__ copy Android related code from this repo as they are very outdated. The `targetSdkVersion` was 22 [at the time](https://github.com/DarkestFloyd/Melody/blob/develop/app/build.gradle#L23) of the project. 

Apart from that, please feel free to browse the repo and for more information or any queries, do to reach out at [nischal (dot) bhatewara (at) gmail (dot) com](mailto:nischal.bhatewara@gmail.com)
